# GraphQL_Project
Project to speak on SE with using GraphQL as RESTful API replacement.
We use flask as web framework and graphene as python implementation of GraphQL.
Also we use Postgre SQL as database management system. I added dump file of our db. You can restore it with postgres command.
docs how you can do that: https://postgrespro.ru/docs/postgresql/9.4/backup-dump
All scripts are located on folder 'app'.
